# Activity 4: Create Photo Text

In this activity we will be creating photo-based text. If you have any questions, please ask!

1.  Download [this image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/green-leaf-trees-908518/){:target="_blank"} for the exercise
2.  Open the photo in GIMP by going to **File -> Open** in the upper menu. Find where you saved the photo and open it. If your browser auromatically saved it for you, it is probably in your **Downloads** folder. It may pop up with another window asking to **Convert to RGB Working Space**. (_Note: there are certain circumstances where you may need to convert an image to a different color profile, such as when importing from a scanner or camera. <img src="images\act-4\1-newlayer.png" alt="new layer menu" style="float:right;width:360px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;">But in this case, it is not necessary._) Click on **Keep**. If you wanted to do this project using one of your own images, it would be best to create a duplicate first, as descibed in previous activities
3.  Click on **Layer** in the top menu and then **New Layer**. In the dialog box that pops up, in the **Fill With** dropdown menu, choose **White** and then click **OK**. A new white layer will appear covering the image and you will see it listed in the **Layers panel** on the right

    <img src="images\act-4\4-morefont.png" alt="font menu" style="float:right;width:180px;margin-left:10px;">
    <img src="images\act-4\4-font.png" alt="font icon" style="float:right;width:90px;margin-left:10px;">

4.  Next, click on the **Text Tool** ("A" icon) in the left toolbar. This will bring up the tool's options below the left toolbar. We will be using the font **Arial Black, Heavy (or Arial Heavy)**. To change the font, **click in the font name field** and start typing **Arial**, and a list of fonts will appear. Select **Arial Black, Heavy**. Below that, enter **Size 504px**, color black, and then lower there is an option for spacing between letters (icon with an "a b" with arrows beneath them). For spacing, we will use **-61**
5.  Click over on the canvas and start typing: type the word **ADVENTURE** in all caps

6.  In the **Layers Panel** on the right, **click on the white layer** to make it the active layer. Just above the layer names there is an option to change the **Opacity**. Decrease it to about 35 so that you are able to see the image beneath it

    <img src="images\act-4\7-moveicon.png" alt="move icon" style="float:right;width:90px;">

7.  **Click back onto the text layer**. Over in the left toolbar, click on the **Move Tool** (four arrows icon) and use it to move the text so the center of the N in the text is over the car in the photo

    <img src="images\act-4\7-move.gif" alt="move" style="width:720px;">

8.  Over in the **Layers Panel**, **right click** on the text layer and then click on **Alpha to Selection**. This will trace a selection around all the text. Next in the **Layers Panel**, click on the **eye icon in the text layer** to make the text invisible, and then **click on the white layer** to make it the active layer

9.  Go to **Edit** in the top menu and click on **Cut**. This will cut out the inside of the selection in the white layer. Then click on **Select** in the top menu and click on **None** to deselect the outlines
10. At this point, you can choose to go back to the **Layers Panel** and increase the **Opacity** of the white layer to 100% so that it is solid white or have it partially transparent so you can see part of the photo. Try turning the **Opacity** up and down to see the difference

11. Note: If you only want to keep th lower part of the image with the text, you can use the **Crop Tool** (as described in an earlier activity) with **Fixed** unchecked to crop the lower part of the image

12. **Save:** Click on **File -> Save As** in the upper left corner. We are going to save this in the GIMP .xcf format, which is the working format within GIMP that will preserve the layers. <img src="images\act-4\12-result.png" alt="final result" style="float:right;width:240px;">Choose where you would like to save the file, and give it a name you will remember. Click **Save**. You can export a JPG or PNG of the image using instructions from Activities #1 or #2
