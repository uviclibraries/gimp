## Why GIMP? 

# **BETTER INTRO HERE**

[TOOL NAME](https://TOOL-URL-HERE.org/){:target="_blank"} Desribe the tool and how it can be used. This is an example of the description for Taguette:

[Taguette](https://taguette.org/) a user-friendly and free web-based tool that helps researchers to code and analyse their qualitative data. Taguette is a great tool for those who need to analyze interviews, reports, transcripts of any kinds, and a variety of text. With the tool, we can create codes and analyse texts easily and export in different file formats. If you have some or a lot of text to analyse, Taguette might be a great option for you.

This workshop uses the OpenSource _Taguette_ software because it is free to use and many find it easier to learn than [other popular commercial software packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_qualitative_data_analysis_software){:target="_blank"}. 

This workshop is not an endorsement of Taguette; there are many options for qualitative analysis and coding and other software may be better in other contexts. While an excellent teaching tool, _Taguette_ imposes some limitations that users should be aware of:

- Only text can be coded. For example videos and images can not be coded.
- Passanges coded with different tags have the same colour in Taguette. 
- Only basic analysis can be done in Taguette. External tools, like Microsoft Excel, can be used for more advanced analysis are covered in this workshop.
